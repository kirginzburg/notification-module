A component / module which can be used to show notification messages within a SPA. Those notifications could be used to display information which give the user a feedback, 
but do not disturb him at the current work. One example would be a chat application, where the notification module displays a slight notification that someone has logged in. 
The module is encapsulated, thus it could be shared across multiple projects. The final result is included into a nice example page, where the features of
the notification module can be tested in.

Also I made some mockups with design, tests and documentation.
